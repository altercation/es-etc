# es-etc

dotfiles and configs. relies on symlinks to $HOME/ and other config locations.
see es-bin repository `conform` utility for symlink creation.

note that some configuration items may also be locally symlinked (i.e. some
vim plugins that are works in progress and maintained as their own repos).
